== Workspaces

Conan workspaces is an experimental feature of conan but great to work with if you work on multiple packages simultaneously. With the https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools[vscode-cmake-tools] from Microsoft and the disroop conan plugin, this is a great setup to work locally. The workspaces settings in conan-settings.json file is used to install conan workspaces.
You can choose the workspace with the corresponding name with the profile picker to install the workspace. 

== Install Workspace

To install a conan workspace use the _install workspace_ button at the bottom or use the "Disroop Conan: Install" command.
